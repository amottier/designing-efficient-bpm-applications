== How to use the solution
=== Processes
To import processes into your Bonita BPM Studio workspace:

1. Click *Import* in the Studio tool bar. This opens a popup.
1. Click *Browse...* in the popup and select one of the `.bos` files.
1. Click *Import* to confirm the import.

NOTE: Importing these example processes will not conflict with the ones you create because diagram names are different. However, if you run a process it will replace yours because process names are the same.

WARNING: Importing `Example-NewVacationRequest-1.0.bos` will replace the Business Data Model (BDM) and `DateTimeScripts` Groovy script that you have defined.

=== REST API extension

1. Click *Portal* in the Studio tool bar.
1. Switch to the *Administrator* profile using the drop-down list in top right corner.
1. Click *Resources*. This opens the Resources view.
1. Click *Add*. This opens a popup.
1. Click and browse your file system to select the `rest-api-extension.zip` file.
1. Click *Next*.

NOTE: The easiest way to test your REST API extension is to deploy a page and include it in an application.
